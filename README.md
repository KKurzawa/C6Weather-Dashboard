# Weather Dashbord

## Description

This project creates a weather dashboard that displays todays weather and the forecast for the next five days of the submitted city. This is an important tool for anyone planning to travel. Building this project helped tighten up my JavaScript skills and introduced me to the use of bootstrap and server side api's.

## Usage

When the page is loaded we see a text box with a search button below. When the user enters a city in the text box and clicks the submit button, the selected city's current weather and 5 day forecast is displayed. The city name is displayed in a list with all other recent searches. When the city in the displayed list is clicked, it's current weather and 5 day forecast are displayed.
